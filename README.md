# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Build the exact same, or at least very similar Portfolio Page using bootstrap <br>

<br><strong><em>'pushing a somewhat finished project'</em></strong>: <br>

The result is workable, however I ended up overwriting a lot of rules set by bootstrap (I'm pretty confident that this isn't the way to use bootstrap). But the overall result did save me half the amount of code in the vanilla_stylesheet (although took me longer to figure it out how to do it with bootstrap). I guess I'll just have to experiment and practice more :) <br>
